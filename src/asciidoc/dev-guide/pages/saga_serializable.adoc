=== Creating SagaSerializable Class for Aggregator [[saga_serializable]]

Providing sample objects for the framework is very important to capture the feature failures that can be occurred due to the version updates of the Aggregator.
You can have a better understanding of version updates through the following topics.

. <<version_casting_architecture,Version Casting Architecture>>.
. <<aggregators_event_casting,Aggregator's Event Casting>>.

Let's look at the implementation of `SagaSerializable` here:

The `SagaSerializable` class provides you a method called `<T> getSamples()` to provide the sample array of objects of your real Aggregator. for each aggregator class that you made should have a separate implementation of `SagaSerializable` for validating the sample object before the application is started. that process ensures that your aggregator object will not face a serialization error while the transactions are being processed in the production.

you can see a sample SagaSerializable `(PlaceOrderAggregatorSample.class)` implementation of the PlaceOrderAggregator.

----
public class PlaceOrderAggregatorSample implements SagaSerializable<PlaceOrderAggregator> { //<1>
    @Override
    public PlaceOrderAggregator[] getSamples() {
        //samples objects for the PlaceOrderAggregator

        //sample-1
        PlaceOrderAggregator aggregator1 = new PlaceOrderAggregator();
        aggregator1.setOrderId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());

        //sample-1
        PlaceOrderAggregator aggregator2 = new PlaceOrderAggregator();
        aggregator2.setOrderId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
        aggregator2.setUsername("mafei");

        //<2>
        return new PlaceOrderAggregator[]{
                aggregator1,
                aggregator2,
        };
    }
}

<1> Implement your custom `PlaceOrderAggregatorSample` from the `SagaSerializable<T>`.
The generic type should be the aggregator that you wish to check the sample object.
According to the example, the Type is `PlaceOrderAggregator`.
Then you will have a method for providing the sample objects for that given type.

<2> Rerun your initialized sample objects by creating a new array for the validation process.

WARNING: Make sure to keep the default constructor for each SagaSerializable implementation.
