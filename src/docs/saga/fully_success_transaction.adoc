As we discussed earlier, we had used a number of microservices for doing one single execution.
Just assume we have used 5 microservices to be executed and all of them have been worked without any errors.
Then there is no revert processes have been executed.
That means all the microservices are up and running and there haven't been occurred exceptions internally inside each microservice.
