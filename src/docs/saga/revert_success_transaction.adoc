In this time, An exception has occurred when one of microservices get execute.
Just assume the coordinator has been executed 3 microservices successfully, but at the 4th one, an error has occurred due to a network exception or whatever internal exception that the microservices have been thrown.
Now the coordinator has to execute revert function regarding all microservices that executed earlier.
So the coordinator will start to execute all the revert functions one by one as a sequence.
If those revert functions have been executed successfully, these kinds of transactions are going to these types.
Simply we did a set of transactions but unfortunately got an error, but all the revert processes are done successfully.
