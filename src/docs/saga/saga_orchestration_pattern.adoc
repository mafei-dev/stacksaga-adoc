In the Orchestration pattern, a single orchestrator is responsible for managing the overall transaction status. If any of the microservices encounters a failure, then the orchestrator is responsible for invoking the necessary compensating transactions. The Saga orchestration pattern is useful for brownfield microservice application development architecture. In other words, this pattern is suitable if we already have a set of microservices and would like to implement the Saga pattern in the application. We need to define the appropriate compensating transactions to proceed with this pattern.
