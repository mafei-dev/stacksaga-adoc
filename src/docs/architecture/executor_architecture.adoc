According to the saga design pattern, sub processes (atomic executions) can have two executions called process execution and compensation execution.
And those executions you van create as the methods in your application anywhere.
But the framework has to know about exactly what is the process execution an is the compensation/revert execution method to be executed when running the whole process.
As an example in your application can have a service called payment service, and that payment service class can have hundreds of methods for many tasks.
Its also have the make payment process method and its revert/compensation method.
But you have to inform those are the methods that you use when the process is executed.
To overcome that, the framework provides a template for you.
That is called as the executor.
According to the framework, the executors are two types.

. Query executors
- If some atomic process has no compensation (query execution), those kinds of processes are used in a query executor.
+
*Example*: If you want to check, the user is active at the time of the transaction happen, and you want to keep the user's activeness until the end of the transaction.
See the implementation.
. Command executors
- If some atomic process has a compensation (command execution), those kinds of processes are used in a command executor.
+
*Example*: Think that you want to create an order and order process is done successfully.
But after the make-payment process is failed.
Then the compensation process will be started.
Now you must have a compensation against the creating order.
So create an order process is a command process, and it goes to a command executor.
