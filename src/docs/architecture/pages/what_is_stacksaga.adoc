StackSaga is an echo system that helps you to manage and monitor your distributed transactions in microservice' architecture.

As you saw in the .... Section, There's a distributed transaction problem in microservice' architecture.
So managing distributed transaction is very complicated without a framework.
StackSaga Saga provides a better and resilient architecture as an *orchestration engine framework* to overcome that problem with a lot of additional features as well.

StackSaga mainly consists of two parts.

. *<<stacksaga_admin,StackSaga Admin>>.* +
StackSaga admin mainly provides the monitoring facilities of the transactions and manages the security.
. *StackSaga Framework*.
- StackSaga Framework provides orchestration engine support for your distributed transactions in your service.


*Quick Understanding:*

Just imagine that you have a business domain for placing an order in microservice architecture.
So you can have multiple services, and you have to visit all over the services to complete the place-odder transaction.

The services might be as follows:

- Order-service
- Payment-service
- Cart-service
- Delivery-Service and many more.

IF you execute the place order process, you have to go through each and every service one by one after competing each of them.
There is no issue with that if the entire process is completed successfully all the time.
But in microservice architecture, it is not possible and there is a possibility to have an at least connection issue.
Just think all the past services are done successfully, but the last execution is failed due to insufficient balance or payment-service's failure.
Then you have to revert (compensation-transaction) all the past executions *one by one as the same-order*
that those services were executed to overcome the eventual consistency according to the Saga design pattern.
It is very complicated if you are going to do manually.
Other than that, just imagine you are able to handle and bare the last failed execution, and you started to revert all the past executions one by one.
Just imagine very unfortunately, you are getting a connection error at the last revert process.

*Oops!*
Now your in a big trouble with your data consistency.
Because your both transaction Forward-process and Revert-process are failed at this moment.
You can do nothing in this kind of situation.

You were unable to reach the target end execution to forward.
Therefore, you stated revert-process for all the past executions one by one (Last-In, First-Out order [*LIFO*] ).
But unfortunately, You were unable to reach the target final revert as well due to a network issue.

Here you can see What happened to your place-order transaction with a diagram.

image::resources/img/revert-failed-transaction-intro.svg[alt="StackSaga revert failed transaction",height=300]

. You Started the place-order transaction there.
. Stopped the place-order transaction due to not sufficient balance.
. Your target transaction ending for a successful transaction.
. Started revert process due the transaction was stopped unsuccessfully.
. The revert process was stopped due to a connection error.
. The target revert process ending for a successful revert transaction.

*How StackSaga framework helps to overcome this problem?*

StackSaga provides a code block (<<command_executor_architecture,Command Executor>>,<<query_executor_architecture, Query Executor>>) to provide your atomic operations that you did same in the place-order transaction.
The only thing that you have to do is to provide the execution-process inside the code-block and notify the exception type whether it is retryable or not.
Then the StackSaga engine will invoke each atomic transaction until the entire transaction gets succeeded (revert success or full process success).

StackSaga orchestration engine follows these concepts behind the scenes.

. Saga design pattern
. Event sourcing
. Eventual consistency.
