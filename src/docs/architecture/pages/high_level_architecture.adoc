In the <<what_is_stacksaga,introduction section>>, We got a clear idea of how microservice architecture works, and what are the challenges that we have to face when implementing the microservice in traditional way.

Here, we are going to see how the StackSaga works together with typical microservice architecture.
It shows how StackSaga does impact on the default https://spring.io/microservices[spring boot microservice architecture].

For your convenience, both *Spring Microservice Architecture* and **Spring Microservice Architecture With StackSaga** diagrams have been added here.

* **Spring Microservice Architecture With StackSaga**

After adding stack saga in the microservice architecture, you can see there are some additional components in the high-level architecture diagram.

TIP: In the diagram, the *Gray* color components and lines are related to the typical microservice architecture, and additional stacksaga related components and lines have been colored by *Green* color.

Let's have a look at all the components and how they are interacted with each other.

. At first glance, you can see a major difference in database architecture.
Due to the fact that StackSaga <<SEC,SEC>> uses *event sourcing* for managing your <<aggregator_architecture,aggregator state>> for each <<executor_architecture,executor>>.
In brief, StackSaga internally uses a database to string your execution data as events.
Therefore, If you are using StackSaga, you have to provide a database as the <<event_store,event-store>>.
+
TIP: Even though the diagram shows event-store per service, It can be configured as a single event-store for all services if the application is currently not a large one. <<event_store,Read more>>.
+
The event-store is accessed by the StackSaga framework.
Therefore, The `StackSaga-Core` library (StackSaga <<SEC,SEC>> is located in this library) should be added to your application.
. Even though it is enough for the event-sourcing, StackSaga provides more additional functionalities like avoiding <<dual_consistency_problem_of_sec_in_microservice,Dual-Consistency Problem>>, <<stacksaga_admin,Monitoring Trace,>> etc.
Therefore, another library should be added to your application called `StackSaga-Discovery`.
// TODO: add a link to why use eureka by the StackSaga framework.
It will interact with your *service-registry* and get to know about the service availability.
+
NOTE: Currently, StackSaga only supports for https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-netflix[Eureka Service Registry].

. Next, Let's have a look at <<stacksaga_admin,StackSaga Admin>>.
// TODO: add a link [facilities]
Admin provides a lot of facilities in the framework.
Primarily feature is monitoring and tracking the transaction's flow and trace.
For monitoring your transactions, Admin should be able to retrieve the transaction data from each event-store.
Internally, `StackSaga-Discovery` library provides and exposes the endpoints for that.

. StackSaga provides a library called `StackSaga-Gateway-Shield` for secure your transaction-endpoints that `StackSaga-Discovery` library provides. `StackSaga-Gateway-Shield` is added as a dependency for your https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway[Spring-Cloud API-Gateway].

As a summary of the image above, you can identify mainly 4 components as new.in the next image below you can see those new components how to interact with the general components.

. StackSaga Coordinator (A Library) and StackSaga Connector (A Library) is located in the individual services.
. StackSaga Shield (A Library) is located in the API gateway.
. StackSaga Server (A Standalone Application) is one separate unit that provides a dashboard.
